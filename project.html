<!-- Project Description: Reaction Time Game
This project is a simple reaction time game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
 The goal is to measure how quickly a user can respond to the appearance of a box on the screen.
 Here's a brief description of each part of the project:

HTML Structure:

The HTML sets up the basic structure of the webpage, including a div with the class output to contain the game elements.
CSS Styling:

The CSS styles the webpage with a background image that covers the entire screen and centers it.
The .message class styles a message element that provides instructions and feedback to the user.
The .box class styles the box element that the user needs to click, setting its size, position, and initial display state.
JavaScript Functionality:

The JavaScript handles the game logic and user interactions.
Initialization: Creates the message and box elements, then appends them to the document.
Start Game: When the user clicks the message, the game starts by recording the start time and hiding the box. 
After a random delay, the box is displayed at a random position.
Box Click: When the user clicks the box, the reaction time is calculated and displayed in the message element.
Utility Functions: Includes a function to generate random numbers for positioning the box and setting the delay time.

How It Works:
1.The user sees a "Press To Start" message.
2.Upon clicking the message, the game starts, and after a random delay, a box appears at a random position on the screen.
3.The user needs to click the box as quickly as possible.
4.The game calculates the time taken from the start to the click and displays it in the message.
5.This project demonstrates basic web development skills, including DOM manipulation, event handling, 
and simple animations using CSS and JavaScript. -->

<!-- //2) Shape Clicker Game: Project Overview
Project Name: Shape Clicker Game

Description: The Shape Clicker Game is a web-based reaction time game designed to measure how quickly a user can respond to the appearance of a shape (a box) on the screen.

Key Features:

Interactive UI: A message prompts the user to start the game.
Randomized Timing and Positioning: The shape appears at random intervals and positions, challenging the userâ€™s reaction time.
Real-Time Feedback: After clicking the shape, the game calculates and displays the user's reaction time in seconds.
Technologies Used:

HTML: Sets up the structure of the game elements.
CSS: Styles the background, message, and shape to create a visually appealing interface.
JavaScript: Handles the game logic, including timing, random positioning, and event handling.
How It Works:

The user clicks a "Press To Start" message to begin the game.
After a random delay, a shape appears at a random position on the screen.
The user clicks the shape as quickly as possible.
The game calculates the reaction time and displays it to the user.
This project showcases skills in front-end development, including dynamic UI updates and user interaction handling. -->
